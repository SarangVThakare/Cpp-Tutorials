/*Expedition: A group of cows grabbed a truck and ventured on an expedition. The truck leaves one unit of fuel every unit of distance it travels.
To repair the truck, the cows need to drive to the nearest town (no more than 10^6 units distance).
On this road, between the town and the current location, there are N(1<=N<=10^5) fuel stops where the cows can stop to acquire additional fuel(1-100 units at each stop).
The cows want to make the minimum possible number of stops for fuels on the way to town. Capacity of the tank is sufficiently large to hold any amount of fuel.
Intial units of fuel: P(1<=P<=10^6)
Intial distance from town: L
Determine the minimum number of stops to reach the town.

Answer:
Create a maxHeap, which stores the fuels available at the stops that we have traversed.
Sort the stops on the basis of distance of stops from intial position of truck.
Keep iterating on the stops, and whenever fuel in the truck becomes empty, take the fuel from the maxHeap and add it.
Maintain the count of stops from which we have taken fuel.
