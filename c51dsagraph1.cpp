/*Nodes: These are the states or vertex. For example users in whatsapp.
Edges: Links between states in a graph. For instance, connections between users.
Undirected: Two- way edges
Directed: One - way edges

Representation:
Adjacency Matrix: 2-D array, where a[i][j] = 1, if there is an edge from i to j else a[i][j] = 0.
So, if its symmetric part corresponds to undirected edges while unsymmetric part corresponds to directed edges.
Adjacency List: Array of lists, where each a[i] is a list of nodes xi, that are reachable from i.

Depth First Search: Parts:-
Pre-Order: First time when call comes on the node.
Inorder: When the call works inside the subtree (in DFS Tree) of that node.
Post-Order: After working on the subtree, call comes back on the node. After this, call won't come on the same node.
Implemented using stacks

Breadth First Search:
Implemented using queues.
Different properties of components of Graph:
Weighted nodes: Values are associated with nodes.
Weighted edges: Values are associated with edges.

/*Dynamic Programming:
Optimal Substructure: We can write a recurrence relation, then a problem is said to have optimal substructure.
E.g. Fibonacci: f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)
Overlapping Subproblem: If our subproblems repeat, then a problem is said to have overlapping subproblem.
E.g. For fibonacci f(n-1) is required for both f(n) and f(n+1), repeating or overlapping problem, so we using power of memory can save time.
Ways to handle Overlapping Subproblem:
1. Memoization(Top-Down): A lookup table is maintained and checked before computation of any state and updated after it. Recursion is involved.
2. Tabulation(Bottom-Up): Solution is built from base. It is an iterative process.

//Memoization(Recursive):
int fib[20]={-1};
int computeFib(int n){
    if(n==0 || n==1){
        return n;
    }
    if(fib[n]!=-1){
        return fib[n];
    }
    int res=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    Memoization part fib[n]=res;
    return res;
}

//Tabulation (Iterative)
int computeFib(int n){
    int arr[n];
    arr[0]=0, arr[1]=1;
    for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
        arr[i]=arr[i-1]+arr[i-2];
    }
    cout<<computeFib(n);
}

Key Points: Minimization and maximization problems are generally solved with dp where we want exhaustive solution, using P&C no greedy approach is working. (Sometimes with binary search on answer).
"Find the number of ways" is also a very popular type of DP Problems.
Where we can form recurrence relation or given in question can be solved using DP. (Sometimes with matrix exponentiation).

/*Graph Terminologies:
Directed Graph: A graph with directed edges.
Undirected Graph: A graph with undirected edges.
Adjacent Vertices: Two vertices with a direct edge connecting them.
Degree of a vertex:
Indegree: Number of incoming edges to a node. Exmaple: Indegree of a vertex (4) is 1.
Outdegree: Number of outgoing edges from a node. Example: Outdegree of vertex (1) is 2.
Path between two vertices: All vertices which comes in the path of two given vertices is called their path.
Connected Graphs: Each node has path from every other node.
Disconnected Graph: Each node does not have path from every other node.
Connected Component: Each connected graph in a disconnected graph is called a connected component.
Cycles in a graph: Path from a vertex to the same vertex in a graph is known as cycle.
Cyclic Graph: Graph that contains cycle is called cyclic graph.
Acyclic Graph: Graph that does not contain cycle is called acyclic graph.
Tree is connected acyclic graph.

Properties of a Tree with n nodes:
1. Number of edges = n-1.
2. There are no cycles present.
3. Each node has path from every other vertex.

Directed Acyclic Graph[DAG]:
As the name suggests, its properties are:
1. It has directed edges.
2. It is acyclic, i.e. no cycles are present.

Complete Graph:
A graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a direct edge.
Number of edges in a complete graph: nC2 = n*(n-1)/2

Weighted Graph: A graph with weighted edges is called weighted graph.
