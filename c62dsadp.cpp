/*Problem Description: Rahul and Neha are playing a coin game. They are given n coins with values x1, x2, …, xn (where ‘n’ is always even).
Players take alternate turns. In each turn, a player picks either the first coin or the last coin from the row and removes it from the row.
The value of the coin is received by that player. Determine the maximum value that Rahul can win if he moves first. Both players play optimally(cleverly).
A[i....j]
1. We can choose A[i]
2. We can choose A[j]
In each case, our opponent will also have two choices. He will try to maximise his score and minimise ours.
Therefore, our subproblem, will reduce to
Choice 1 = a[i]+min(solve(i+2,j),solve(i+1,j-1))
Choice 2 = a[j]+min(solve(i,j-2),solve(i+1,j-1))
We would return maximum of this
