Dijkstra Algorithm:
Problem:
Given a weighted graph. Find the single source shortest path from a vertex u to all the vertices in the graph. If the node is unreachable, then print -1.
Note: The weights of the edges must be positive.
Idea:
1. Assign a distance values to all vertices in the input graph.
Intialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance values as 0 for the source vertex.
2. While set is not empty.
    A. Pick a vertex u from set s that has minimum distance value.
    B. Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u.

/*Bellman Ford Algorithm:
Problem:
From a source vertex v, find the shortest distance to all other nodes in the graph.
Idea:
1. Intially d[v]=0 and for all other elements d[]=infinity
2. In each pass, relax all the edges.
    i.e. for edge (a,b) having weight w,
    d[b]=min(d[b],d[a]+w)
3. Assuming no negative edge cycle, since there are n vertices, shortest path can only contain 'n-1' edges. 
   Therefore, we will get our answer in at most 'n-1' passes.
   
Advantages:
It will work for negative edges and negative cycles.
It can detect negative cycles as well, as if after n-1 passes answer is updating and minimizing, so it contains negative cycle.
